# EICViBE to Simulator Interface Configuration
# This file defines the mapping between EICViBE elements and simulator-specific elements
# 
# Unit Conversion Notes:
# - EICViBE uses SI units with angles in radians (consistent with XSuite)
# -

# Element Mappings:

# From EICViBE's elements/parameters to other engines 's element/parameters and possible unit conversions:

Drift:
  XSuite:
    type: Drift
    parameters:
      length: length  # meters

Quadrupole:
  XSuite:
    type: Quadrupole
    parameters:
      length: length  # meters
      MagneticMultipoleP.kn1: k1  # 1/m^2
      MagneticMultipoleP.ks1: k1s  # 1/m^2
